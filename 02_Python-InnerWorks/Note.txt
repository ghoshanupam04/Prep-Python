#Python Inner-Working:

** IMP: 
Python was Interpreted Language. Means, the code is run line by line, 
and is converted into bytecode each time the program is run.**

Python make byte code. (Most in case this was hidden).
When we install Python then in same time another one is autometically installed that 
is Pythonn-VM(Python Vartual Machine). This is use to run the actual code.

steps:
1. Compile to Byte Code. (Byte Ccode: Low lavel Code & Platform Independent).
2. Byte Code run faster.

__Pycash__
-> Python make a system folder taht is useful only for Python.

hello_world.cpython-312
-> hello_world: File Name
-> cpython: Standerd Python Version
-> 3.12: version


Python vertual Machine (PVM)?
-> It is a Software. This is run time engine. In the PVM a loop was continnusly 
running. When we drop the code and the code was exicuted.
